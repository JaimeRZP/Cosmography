# Cosmography Data Repo

My compilations of cosmography data. 
Please feel free to use.
Data not my own.
## Example

```Python
import sys
import numpy as np
sys.path.insert(1, '/home/user/xCell')
import cosmography as CG

data = CG.Sixdf()
```

## Citation
If you use data from this repo please cite the relevant groups as given in the DocStrings of each data module. Moreover, please cite:
